Copying the `.devcontainer/` directory into the root of your local Chemotion ELN repository enables you to run and edit the ELN inside a Visual Studio Code development-container.

Prerequisites:
* Visual Studio Code installation
  * Remote-Containers extension
* Docker installation
  * non-root user can issue Docker commands: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user



Note that this is an interim solution until the "official" development-container is available.
